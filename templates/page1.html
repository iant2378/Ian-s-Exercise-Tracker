    <h1>Advice on Gaining Weight</h1>
    <p>If you're looking to gain weight, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eat calorie-dense foods:</strong> Focus on foods that are high in calories but also provide essential nutrients, such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and dried fruits.</li>
        <li><strong>Consume more protein:</strong> Protein is essential for building muscle mass. Include protein-rich foods like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes in your diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat frequently:</strong> Aim to eat every 2-3 hours to ensure you're consistently providing your body with fuel for growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Include healthy fats:</strong> Incorporate sources of healthy fats, such as olive oil, coconut oil, and fatty fish, into your meals to increase calorie intake.</li>
        <li><strong>Lift weights:</strong> Resistance training is essential for building muscle mass. Focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses to maximize muscle growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support muscle function and overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Get enough rest:</strong> Allow your body time to recover and grow by getting adequate sleep each night.</li>
    </ul>
